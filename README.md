**Combo-Banana** is a powerful and intuitive application that allows you to define and execute custom multi-step image processing workflows using natural language.

Powered by [Google's Nano Banana](https://blog.google/products/gemini/updated-image-editing-model/), it transforms your textual instructions into a sequence of image manipulation tasks and runs them for you.

## ‚ú® Benefits

- **Automate Repetitive Tasks:** Streamline your image editing process by automating recurring tasks.
- **Save Time and Resources:** Significantly reduce the time and effort required for complex image processing.
- **Explore AI Creativity:** Leverage the power of generative AI to discover new and exciting image styles and effects.
- **Tailor-Made Workflows:** Create workflows that are perfectly suited to your specific creative or professional needs.

## Examples

Below are screenshots illustrating the two main steps of using the application:

1. **Workflow Definition:** Use natural language to define a series of image editing steps. The application will convert your input into a structured workflow.

just app
```

Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the console (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

This project uses `just` to simplify common development tasks.

- **Check Code Quality:**

    ```bash
    just check
    ```

    This will run linting, formatting checks, type checking, and unit tests.

- **Format Code:**

    ```bash
    just format
    ```

    This will automatically format the code to match the project's style.

- **Clean Up:**

    ```bash
    just clean
    ```

    This will remove temporary files and caches.

## üê≥ Docker

You can also build and run the application using Docker.
